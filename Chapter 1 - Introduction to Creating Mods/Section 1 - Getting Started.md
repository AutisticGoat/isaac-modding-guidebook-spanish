# Motivation

Although many games offer mod support, many find getting started with modding The Binding of Isaac: Repentance difficult. This is a result of a lack of beginner-friendly resources in text format and the game's notoriously limited API.

The aim of this guidebook is to provide a clear and simple introduction to modding The Binding of Isaac: Repentance. By the end of the guidebook, you should be equipped to start creating your own mods.

# Overview

This guidebook currently covers:

1. How to create a basic resource replacement mod

# Required Tools

To begin modding, you only need two things:

* [The Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/)
    * Console versions do not support modding.
    * This guide focuses on Repentance. Therefore, much of the information will not work on Afterbirth+ due to API changes.
* An **Integrated Development** (**IDE**)
  * Visual Studio Code is highly recommended for its robust tooling and extensive ecosystem. This guide assumes you are using VS Code, but you can still follow along with a different IDE.

It should be noted that this guidebook **won't** go over how to use an IDE. If you are using Visual Studio Code, a 7 minute video is provided in the "Other Useful Resources" section that goes over the basics.

# What about REPENTOGON?

This guide initially focuses on the vanilla API and does not immediately delve into REPENTOGON. However, REPENTOGON will be introduced and explored in a later chapter.
